# SMS Spam Classification

I'm excited to share my latest project: an SMS Spam Classifier.

This model predicts whether an SMS is spam or not spam. Key features include:

- **Spam Detection**: Accurately classifies SMS messages as spam or not spam.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using Streamlit for an interactive user experience.
- **Technologies Used**: Developed with Python and machine learning.

This tool aims to enhance SMS security by helping users identify and filter out spam messages effectively.

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in learning more about this project or discussing potential collaborations!
